## The API structure

The Trainline API response follows a pattern similar to JSON:API where each entity's details are independently described and their relation is indicated using their ID/URI. This is in contrast to nesting the related fields.

The main components of the response are,

`journey` Holds the high-level information of each option, like, legs, time, duration, etc

`section` Each journey consists of one or more sections. A section can have a single leg or multiple legs. A group of legs is considered as one section when the operating carrier is the same e.g., Deutsche Bahn

`alternatives` An alternative is an option given for a ticket in a section. Alternatives differ by class, comfort, and flexibility. A section can have one or more alternatives for different classes and flexibilities

## Assumptions

1. Trainline has three flexibility options, namely, `nonflexi`, `semiflexi` and `flexi`
2. Bus tickets does not have first class tickets - only standard-semiflexi ticket
3. If an alternative has more than one fare, I picked the first one to match the price shown in the segment
4. In the result, the `service_agencies` are the transport companies e.g., DB. But if you mean booking system as `service_agencies` then `thetrainline` should be hard-coded for this test.
5. The `fares->name` in the result is the comfort name
6. The `fares->comfort_class` in the result is `1` but Trainline does not provide a number for class names, it has `Standard` and `First class` classes. So I added the actual name instead of a number. But if that was intentional, we can map it to a number. I commented the logic [here](https://github.com/ssvignesh24/trainlane/blob/main/models/journey.rb#L63).
